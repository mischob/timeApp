# Work Time Tracking Feature Analysis

## Original Use Case
We need to build a work time tracking feature for an employee. The employee works typically 3 days per week and needs to accumulate a total of 16 working hours weekly. Key requirements include:
* A start/stop function to easily record working time
* The ability to manually enter or edit past working times
* A mobile-friendly interface for quick access
* A desktop version for better overview and export functionality (e.g., Excel)

## Extracted Requirements

### User Goals
1. Track daily working hours accurately
2. Monitor progress toward weekly hour requirements
3. Easily record time on both mobile and desktop devices
4. Edit time entries when corrections are needed
5. Export time records for reporting/administrative purposes

### Functional Requirements
1. Start/stop timer functionality for real-time time tracking
2. Manual time entry capability for past dates
3. Edit functionality for existing time entries
4. Export feature to generate Excel files
5. Cross-platform compatibility (mobile and desktop interfaces)
6. Display of accumulated hours (implied by the 16-hour weekly requirement)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Usability**: Mobile interface must be "mobile-friendly" for quick access
2. **Usability**: Desktop interface should provide "better overview"
3. **Compatibility**: Must work on both mobile and desktop platforms
4. **Interoperability**: Must support Excel export format

## Missing Areas & Considerations

### Questions for Stakeholder Clarification

#### Business Rules & Constraints
1. How should the system handle the 3-day work week schedule? Should it prevent time entries on non-working days or just provide warnings?
answ: at the end, only the weekly hours are important. The standard will be 3 days, but it could be more or less. This may be only a help for the UI but no reason for errors or warnings.
2. What happens if an employee works more or less than 16 hours in a week? Are there alerts, notifications, or restrictions?
answ: we want to see the total over hours or under hours per week, per month and per year. If there is over hour, the employee might take a day of or work less.
3. Are there any maximum daily hour limits or break time requirements that need to be enforced?
answ: For simplification, this is ignored at the moment.
4. Should the system track overtime, and if so, how should it be calculated for part-time employees?
answ: yes as mention in the answer to 3. Over time should be tracked and it should be a simple total number at the moment where less work is reducing it. 

#### User Management & Authentication
1. How will users authenticate to access the system?
answ: We have a Azure B2C in place for that. Use it. 
2. Will there be different user roles (employee, supervisor, admin)?
answ: No, at the moment, the employee has all rights.
3. Can supervisors or managers view and/or edit their team members' time entries?
answ: this is a personal tool and not for managers.

#### Data & Reporting
1. What specific data fields should be included in the Excel export?
answ: 
2. How long should time entry records be retained?
3. Are there any specific reporting requirements beyond the Excel export?
4. Should the system generate any automated reports or summaries?

#### Technical Implementation
1. Should the mobile interface be a native app, progressive web app, or responsive web design?
answ: i do not want to maintain a native app. it should be a responsive web design.
2. Are there any specific browser or device compatibility requirements?
answ: It should definitly work on Apple and Android.
3. Is real-time synchronization required between mobile and desktop interfaces?
answ: in my ideal imagination, mobile and desktop is the same web app but with different optimized views.
4. Should the system work offline and sync when connected?
answ: yes it should. I can not guarantee full connection at any time!

#### Time Entry Details
1. What level of detail is required for time entries (just hours, or specific start/end times)?
answ: The detail should be on minutes. The visualization in hours. 
2. Should the system capture work categories, projects, or tasks along with time entries?
answ: Not at the moment!
3. How should the system handle time zones if employees work remotely?
answ: The time zone shall always be assumed "Berlin"
4. What date/time format preferences should be supported?
answ: Germany formats

#### Approval Workflow
1. Is there an approval process for time entries?
answ: No, its a private employee tool
2. Who needs to approve timesheets, and how often?
answ: see above!
3. Should employees be able to submit their timesheets for review?
answ: No

#### Integration & Compliance
1. Does this system need to integrate with existing HR or payroll systems?
answ: No!
2. Are there any compliance requirements (labor laws, company policies) that should be considered?
answ: No!
3. Should the system maintain an audit trail of all changes to time entries?
answ: No!

#### Error Handling & Validation
1. How should the system handle overlapping time entries?
answ: Robust design! Keep the time for visualize but do not count it as double time worked!
2. What validation rules should be applied to manual time entries?
answ: 
3. How should the system handle timer sessions that cross midnight?
answ: take the work time partly to the right days. 

## Summary
This analysis reveals that while the basic functionality is clear, many important details about business rules, technical implementation, and integration requirements need to be clarified before development can begin. The questions above should be addressed with stakeholders to ensure the final product meets all business needs and technical requirements.
